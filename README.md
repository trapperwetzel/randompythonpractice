# randompythonpractice
this is just a random repo I have for random leetcode questions or when im doing free courses for python. 
Right now I am semi-speed running a begginer/intermediate course just to rehash my python for leetcode. 
I am doing this because i haven't had alot of time to use python after a alot of focus on my internship and self-learning C# ASP.NET
